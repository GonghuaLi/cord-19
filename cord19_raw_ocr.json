Top: the procedure from PA to E0P0 represents translocation, which involves r1, r\u201a\u00c4\u00ec1 (reversible EF-G binding), rTL0 (GTP hydrolysis, unlocking conformation change, tRNA movement and Pi release), and r45 (re-locking conformation change and EF-G dissociation). The E0P0 complex then undergoes aa-tRNA selection: from E0P0 to P0A0. The selection of aa-tRNA involves: k1, k\u201a\u00c4\u00ec1 (reversible EF-Tu binding), k2, k\u201a\u00c4\u00ec2 (reversible codon recognition), k345 (GTPase activation, GTP hydrolysis, EF-Tu conformation change and dissociation), and k6 (aa-tRNA rejection by proofreading), or k7 (aa-tRNA accommodation). The elongation cycle without a \u201a\u00c4\u00ec1 PRF event results in synthesis of non-frameshift proteins (NFS). Pathway I in green suggests that \u201a\u00c4\u00ec1 PRF occurs during the relocking step in the first translocation, leading to the formation of FSm. Pathway Ia indicates that the E02P02 complex may interact with a zero frame aa-tRNA and eventually produce FSz. Pathways II suggests that \u201a\u00c4\u00ec1 PRF occurs during aa-tRNA selection and accommodation, resulting in FSz. Pathway III suggests that \u201a\u00c4\u00ec1 PRF occurs during the second translocation step, resulting in FSz production.","ocr":"EF-Tu*GTP*A.\nEF-G*GTP\nk2\nk,\nr45\nTTLO\nk2\nE,P.A, OR\nE,Po.E,PA' -\nEFGgdp\nPAEFGgtp\nE,P\nPA\nPA.\nPA,CP\nK2\nCR\nk2\nk1\nK345\nK.1\nEFGgdp\nka45\nPo EF-Tu*GTP*A.\nKe\nKpas2\nPozA02\nKpt\nPA.\nEF-Tu*GTP*A,\nEo2P02\nK.pas2\nKpt\nEF-Tu*GTP*A,K\nPozAcz\npt\nPA,pt\nE\u201ePozA\nK2 11 k2\nEg2PozA\n= FS,\n%3D\nEP02A, OR\npaEFGgtp\nTILO\nCR\nK345\nEFGgdp\neo2Po2\nK385\neoP.

TREM2 has been proposed to bind to a variety of different ligands, categorized here by lipids, lipoproteins and ligands associated with damage- or pathogen-related molecular patterns. These ligands bind to the TREM2 receptor. Following ligand binding, TREM2 can associate with DAP12 homodimers or DAP12\/DAP10 heterodimers to mediate downstream signaling. This signaling requires phosphorylation of the adaptor, following which activating (shown on left in green) or inhibitory (shown on right in red) signaling components can bind. These activating components have been shown to initiate different downstream pathways that lead to cell proliferation and differentiation, survival, phagocytosis, chemotaxis and inflammation. While many other signaling components are thought to play a role downstream of TREM2 activation, only those validated as part of the signaling pathway responsible for the listed functions have been included here. Association with inhibitory components is thought to prevent activation of these downstream pathways.

(A) Biogenesis of sfRNAs. A pseudoknot-stabilized three junction helix is formed in the 3\u201a\u00c4\u2264 UTR of flaviviral genomes. This blocks the 5\u201a\u00c4\u2264 to 3\u201a\u00c4\u2264 processing and nucleolytic activity of the exonuclease XRN1, which triggers accumulation of sfRNAs in the cell. (B) Functions of sfRNAs. The accumulation of sfRNAs impacts several cellular pathways which can favor viral infection: in one mechanism, stalling at the sfRNA pseudoknots sequesters XRN1 away from its usual targets decreasing mRNA decay, including decay of transcripts involved in the antiviral response. This further could contribute to the cytokine storm observed upon infection. In another mechanism a high amount of sfRNAs saturates Dicer and consequently inhibits the RNAi\/miRNA pathway. sfRNAs have also been reported to accumulate in stress granules and interact with CAPRIN1, G3BP2, and G3BP1 that are important for translation of ISG mRNAs. Finally, sfRNAs may interfere directly with the PRR mediated IFN-I activation pathway.

Different innate immune recognition receptors are involved in sensing various types of viral nucleic acids in distinct categories of cells during viral infections, which may promote different types of anti-viral defenses. For each selected sensor shown, the types of viral nucleic acids recognized and the downstream signaling cascade induced are represented in a simplified, schematic manner. The potential specific role of each cell type in anti-viral defenses is also indicated at the bottom of each panel. (A) Potentially all types of infected cells can detect endogenous viral replication through cytosolic sensors triggering their local production of IFN-\u0152\u2264\/\u0152\u00aa to control viral replication in an autocrine and paracrine fashion in infected tissues. (B) Uninfected XCR1+ DCs selectively produce high levels of IFN-\u0152\u00aa and IFN-\u0152\u2264 upon engulfment of materials containing dsRNA and the consecutive triggering of TLR3 in endosomes. The receptor of IFN-\u0152\u00aa is mostly expressed by epithelial cells. Hence, XCR1+ DCs might be involved in inducing local IFN responses in virally infected epithelial tissues. Since XCR1+ DCs are especially efficient at producing IFN-III upon HCV stimulation, they might contribute to local or systemic IFN production during infection with this virus, to promote IFN-\u0152\u00aa-mediated protection of hepatocytes. Uninfected XCR1+ DCs and other uninfected cells may produce some IFN-\u0152\u2264 upon engulfment of materials containing ssRNA and the consecutive triggering of TLR8 in endosomes. The contribution of this pathway to anti-viral defense is not well understood yet, in part because mouse TLR8 is deficient for this function. (C) Uninfected pDCs selectively produce high levels of all subsets of IFNs upon engulfment of materials containing ssRNA or CpG DNA and the consecutive triggering of TLR7\/9 in endosomes. However, pDCs seem to be activated for this function only in lymphoid tissues. Hence, pDC might contribute to systemic IFN production during blood-borne viral infections or as a failsafe mechanism activated upon abnormal widespread dissemination of a viral infection once it has escaped local confinement at its portal of entry.

Binding of the PfEMP-1 CIDR1\u0152\u00b1-derived peptide, MC179, to virus-upregulated CD36 prevents Akt phosphorylation while inducing RTA-dependent KSHV reactivation via the MAPK\/p38 pathway.

The grey dashed line highlights specific pathways of interest. Black arrows highlight reactions suggested by the lipidomic data and grey arrows represent reactions not observed in the data. Metabolites highlighted in boxes (solid line) are up regulated (white) or down regulated (grey) in DENV infected mosquito cells. 1. Through the recruitment and activation of FAS, DENV stimulates de novo phospholipid biosynthesis in the replication complex . 2. Inhibition of this process with C75 disrupts the cellular lipid repertoire in mosquito cells to be unfavorable for virus replication. 3. The lipidomic analyses reveal an up regulation of fatty acids such as palmitic (C16) and stearic (C18) acid. These fatty acids are intermediates in the biosynthesis of phospholipids, which is up regulated during DENV infection. Interestingly, in DENV infected cells the prevalent phospholipids primarily consist of C16 and C18 unsaturated acyl chains. Very long chain fatty acids are not significantly up regulated during infection. 4. FAS activity also stimulates de novo sphingolipid biosynthesis. In the lipidomic analyses, the up regulation of intermediates such as N-palmitoylesphingosine suggests sphingolipid biosynthesis is activated during DENV infection. Specifically, SM and CER are enriched in DENV infected cells. Alternately, the up regulation in CER (and DG) during infection could result from the degradation of SM through the activity of sphingomyelinases (Smase). The resulting CER and DG could be redirected into several signaling pathways or be utilized for de novo phospholipid biosynthesis. The glycopshingolipids, GlcCER and GalCER are down regulated during DENV infection, which suggest that they are catabolized to produce CER. 5. Lipidomic analyses also suggest the up regulation of triacylglycerol catabolism (Lipolysis) in DENV infected cells. This pathway results in the generation of MG, DG and palmitic acid. These intermediates are all up regulated in DENV infected cells and could be utilized for downstream signaling or de novo phospholipid biosynthesis. It has also been shown that TG catabolism is necessary for mitochondrial \u0152\u2264-oxidation during DENV infection . 6. Elevated levels of LPC in DENV infected cells also suggest activation of PC hydrolysis by PLA2. This enzyme is activated during DENV infection.

The proteolytic processing of the large, transmembrane, amyloid precursor protein (APP) occurs in two distinct amyloidogenic and non-amyloidogenic pathways. The amyloidogenic pathway involves the sequential cleavage of APP by an aspartic proteinase, \u0152\u2264-secretase, which releases a soluble ectodomain (sAPP\u0152\u2264) and the C-terminal fragment CTF99. This, in turn, is cleaved by another aspartic proteinase, \u0152\u2265-secretase, generating the transcriptional regulator APP intracellular domain (AICD), and releasing the 39\u201a\u00c4\u00ec42 amino acid amyloid-\u0152\u2264 peptide (A\u0152\u2264). Due to its very high ability to aggregation, A\u0152\u2264 forms dimers, trimers, and higher level oligomers which are toxic to cells and cause neuronal death. Formation of amyloid plaques from A\u0152\u2264 aggregates in complex with other proteins is a hallmark of AD but is considered as a scavenging process. In the non-amyloidogenic pathway APP molecules are cleaved at the \u0152\u00b1-secretase site within the A\u0152\u2264-domain releasing a soluble ectodomain sAPP\u0152\u00b1 and the C-terminal fragment CTF83. Proteolytic cleavage of CTF83 by \u0152\u2265-secretase releases AICD and p3 fragment whose functions are still unknown. The AICD fragment produced in the amyloidogenic pathway binds to a stabilizing factor Fe65 and in a complex with other factors (the histone acetyl transferase, Tip60, and a Mediator complex subunit Med12) can act as transcription factor regulating expression of a variety of genes, including an A\u0152\u2264-degrading enzyme neprilysin. This process was found to be specific to the neuronal APP695 isoform. AICD produced in the non-amyloidogenic pathway and from other APP isoforms (APP751 and APP770) is most likely to be degraded (e.g., by some intracellular proteases, e.g., insulin-degrading enzyme).

(A) Viral classes containing predominantly enveloped and non-enveloped viruses are coloured in blue and grey, respectively. Although not enveloped, viruses such as rotaviruses can also exploit the host-glycosylation pathways to modify their proteins. (B) Following mRNA synthesis, the mature tri-glucosylated N-linked glycan precursor, dolichol-P-P-glycan, is co-translationally transferred en bloc by oligosaccharyltransferase to the asparagine residue of an Asn-X-Ser\/Thr sequon on a nascent polypeptide chain. Following transfer of the precursor glycan to the protein, glucosidases in the ER remove the three glucose residues while the protein folds in the Calnexin\/Calreticulin cycle. A series of ER and Golgi mannosidases subsequently cleave mannose residues down to the Man5GlcNAc2 glycan. The action of GlcNAc transferase-I (GlcNAcT-I) initiates the first branch of the N-glycan. Once \u0152\u00b1-Mannosidase II removes the two remaining outer mannose residues, other glycan processing enzymes such as galactosyl-, fucosyl- and sialyl-transferases, can act to construct a huge assortment of complex-type glycans. (C) The mucin-type O-linked glycosylation pathway is initiated by a family of ppGalNAc transferases that covalently link a N-acetylgalactosamine (GalNAc) monosaccharide to any serine, threonine and tyrosine residue. Following this conjugation, a series of glycosyltransferases can act upon the primary GalNAc residue to generate the four common O-linked glycan cores. Each of these cores can be extended and processed further to generate numerous mucin-type O-linked glycans.

Upstream regulatory pathway: Activated PERK phosphorylates eIF2\u0152\u00b1, which results in the translation of ATF4. ATF4 translocates to the nucleus, which increases the expression of CHOP and ATF3. CHOP and ATF3 then bind to the promoters of the target genes, upregulating their expression. ATF6 translocates to Golgi apparatus where it is activated by proteolysis. Activated ATF6 transcriptionally upregulates CHOP expression. Additionally, ATF6 can regulate XBP-1 to activate CHOP. Activation of IRE1\u0152\u00b1 processes unspliced XBP-1 mRNA into activated XBP1(s), which enters the nucleus and controls the expression of CHOP. IRE1\u0152\u00b1 activates the apoptotic signaling kinase 1 (ASK1), which in turn phosphorylates p38 MAPK\/JNK, and activates CHOP. In addition, Bag5 can reduce CHOP expression and increase Bcl-2 gene expression. Downstream regulatory pathway: CHOP triggers the intrinsic apoptotic pathway through the inhibition of BCL-2, BCL-XL, MCL-1, and the upregulation of BIM, which regulates BAX-BAK-mediated mitochondrial outer membrane permeabilization. This leads to cytochrome c release and the caspase cascade. CHOP can also regulate apoptosis by upregulating the expression of the TRB3 gene and preventing Akt phosphorylation, which inhibits the activity of caspases-3\/9. CHOP triggers the extrinsic apoptotic pathway through the upregulation of DR4 and DR5, which regulate the caspase-8-mediated cascade. This leads to Bid cleavage into tBid, which regulates the BAX-BAK-mediated mitochondrial apoptosis pathways. CHOP can also trigger the ERO1\u0152\u00b1-IP3R-Ca2+-CaMKII pathway. ROS can also trigger Ca2+-dependent mitochondrial apoptosis. CHOP can directly activate GADD34 (DNA damage protein), which, combined with phosphatase 1 protein (PP1), dephosphorylates eIF2\u0152\u00b1, and results in protein translation recovery, increased ER stress, and cell apoptosis.","ocr":"ER\nIRE1\nER\nATF-6\nTRAF-2\nXBP-1(u)\nPERK\nelF2a\nASK1\nXBP-1(s)\nP38MAPK\nUNK\nPP1\nGADD34\nelF2a\nC-jun\nATF-4\nDR4\nCHOP\nDR5\nATF-3\nBag5\nERO10\nBcl-2\nIP3R\nBim\nBcl-XL\nMcl-1\nCa2+\nCaspase-9\nBax\nBak\nCaMKII\nCaspase-3\nHOUTU\napoptosis\nNOX2\nROS\nMitochondria\nInhibition\nStimulation\nCaspase-8\nBid\ntBid\nTRB-3\nAKT\n","pmcid":"PMC6328441","papertitle":"The C\/EBP Homologous Protein (CHOP) Transcription Factor Functions in Endoplasmic Reticulum Stress-Induced Apoptosis and Microbial Infection."}

Type I IFNs bind to the heterodimeric transmembrane IFN-\u0152\u00b1\/\u0152\u2264 receptor (IFNAR), which is composed of the two subunits: IFNAR1 and IFNAR2. The c-termini of IFNAR1 and IFNAR2 are associated with the tyrosine kinase 2 (TYK2) and Janus kinase 1 (JAK1), respectively, and activation of the receptor transduces the phosphorylation of JAK1 and TYK2 by tyrosine phosphorylation. This initiates a signaling cascade composed of proteins of the signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) family. The STAT1 and STAT2 proteins are activated upon JAK1 phosphorylation, dimerize and together with IRF9, form the ISG factor 3 (ISGF3) complex. This complex translocates to the nucleus and binds to IFN-stimulated response elements (ISREs) in interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs) promoters to initiate gene transcription. Signaling through IFNAR can also occur independent of IRF9 recruitment through STAT1 homodimers that can bind to IFN-\u0152\u2265-activated sites (GAS) in ISG promoters. Both pathways initiate transcription that promotes the induction of a range of pro-inflammatory mediators and enhance the antiviral state. The JAK\u201a\u00c4\u00ecTYK signaling pathway can also promote signaling pathways independent of STAT signaling. One such pathway includes MAPKs, which are important for signals regulating important cellular functions such as gene transcription, post-transcription, apoptosis, and cell-cycle progression. Specifically, the p38 signaling cascade after IFN-stimulation drives transcription of genes that are important for inducing the antiviral effects of type I IFNs and are regulated by ISREs and GAS. Further to MAPK, the type I IFN receptor signaling can also activate the phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) signaling pathway. The phosphorylation of PI3K causes the activation of the RAC-\u0152\u00b1 serine\/threonine-protein kinase (AKT1)\/cAMP responsive-element-binding protein that can bind smad binding elements (SBE).

In animals, IRE1 oligomerizes in the plane of the ER membrane in stressed cells, leading to trans-autophosphorylation and activation. Activated IRE1 mediates the sequence-specific cleavage of the XBP1 mRNA in higher eukaryotes, deleting a small RNA fragment (intron) and finally producing a spliced mRNA (XBP1s) with a frame shift in the coding sequence. Spliced XBP1s encodes a potent transcriptional activator (XBP1s), whereas the unspliced XBP1 mRNA (XBP1u) encodes an inhibitor of the UPR (XBP1u). In mammals, it seems that XBP1s regulates a subset of UPR genes that promote ERAD of misfolded proteins and refold proteins. In cultured Drosophila melanogaster cells, activated IRE1 can promote the cleavage of mRNAs, including XBP1 mRNA, leading to their degradation. This reduces the load on the stressed ER and might facilitate reprogramming of the ER-associated protein synthesis and translocation machinery. In cells infected by viruses such as HCV, the IRE1 pathway is manipulated by the virus via repressing the transcriptional activity of XBP1s. In addition, some viruses might also promote the IRE1-dependent mRNA decay as a means to manipulate the IRE1 pathway. In plants, IRE1 homologs were detected in the genomes of Arabidopsis and rice a decade ago. However, the target of IRE1 was not identified until 2011. The mRNA of transcriptional factor bZIP60 is the substrate of IRE1 in plants. Similar to XBP1 in animals, unspliced bZIP60 (bZIP60u) is processed by activated IRE1. The protein product (bZIP60s) translated from the spliced bZIP60 (bZIPs) is translocated into the nucleus to activate the expression of UPR genes such as chaperones. Different from XBP1u, plant bZIP60u protein, translated from bZIP60u mRNA, is retained in the ER membrane. Sensing unfolded proteins in the ER lumen, bZIP60u undergoes a proteolytic processing, releasing bZIP60s. A recent study has shown that the expression of bZIP60 was increased by PVX infection. However, the roles of the UPR pathway in virus infection have only begun to be investigated in plants. Critical unanswered questions need to be addressed in the future, such as whether viruses modulate the IRE1 pathway via inhibiting the transcriptional activity of bZIP60s (indicated by \u201a\u00c4\u00fa?\u201a\u00c4\u00f9).","ocr":"ER stress\nER stress\nER lumen\nER lumen\nDZIP60U\nCytosol\nCytosol\nIRE1\nIRE1\nDZIP60S\nMRNAS such as XBP1\nMRNA processing\nMRNA processing\nDZIP60U\nXBP1U MRNA\nXBP15 MRNA\nLigase\nVirus\nIntron\nDZIP60S\nVirus\nIntron\nXBP1U,\nXBP15\nDZIP60S\nXBP1U\nXBP15\nDZIP60S\n> Chaperones\nChaperones\nERAD\nUPR genes\nAnimal\nPlant\n","pmcid":"PMC3531707","papertitle":"Virus-induced ER stress and the unfolded protein response."}

Upon ER stress such as virus infection, protein kinase PERK oligomerizes in the ER membrane and is activated via trans-autophosphorylation. The activated PERK phosphorylates a subunit of eIF2, which inhibits the exchange factor eIF2B from recycling eIF2 to its active GTP-bound form. In addition, dsRNA-activated protein kinase R (PKR) can also activate this pathway independently of PERK. The resulting reduced activities of eIF2B and the eIF2 complex account for all of the important consequences of PERK activity, such as translation inhibition of most mRNAs, which reduces protein synthesis and lowers ER loading. However, some mRNA such as ATF4 gains a selective advantage for translation via phosphorylated eIF2. ATF4 in turn contributes to the transcriptional activation of CHOP, XBP1, GADD34, and other genes involved oxidative stress and cell death. GADD34 is a regulatory subunit of protein phosphatase (PP) 1 that dephosphorylates eIF2\u0152\u00b1 and recovers the activity of eIF2, constituting a negative feedback loop for regulation of PERK signaling. A constitutive phosphatase CreP also promotes eIF2 dephosphorylation. Viruses such as CMV may directly exploit the negative loop to terminate the PERK signaling pathway, via increasing the expression of ATF4, because the prolonged closure of protein synthesis is harmful to virus infection. Some viruses, such as HSV1 and ASFV, may produce a viral factor, which is homologous to host GADD34, to restore the activity of eIF2 along with PP1. Other viruses such as HCV may encode a viral protein that binds to PERK as a pseudosubstrate and thus, inhibits PERK activation. Finally, viruses such as LCMV may selectively activate the branches of the UPR to favor their replication. At present, no PERK-like pathway has been found in plants.","ocr":"Viral factor\nER stress\nER lumen\nPERK\nPP1\nelF2\nPP1\/GADD34\nPKR\nPP1\/CREP\nATF4\nMost MRNAS\nVirus\nelF2B\nProtein synthesis\nER loading\nXBP1\nATF4\nCHOP\nAnti-oxidants\nUPR genes\nGADD34\nCell death\nNegative loop\nCytosol\nCHOP\nUPR genes\n","pmcid":"PMC3531707","papertitle":"Virus-induced ER stress and the unfolded protein response."}

IFITM proteins restrict the cytosolic access of virions undergoing endocytosis, possibly via inhibition of virus-cell fusion and destruction in an endolysosomal pathway. Cytokine regulation; IFITM3 is a negative regulator of the interferon response because it accelerates the turnover of IRF3 in autophagosomes. It also suppresses the production of IL-6, a pro-inflammatory cytokine which, itself, can also induce the expression of IFITM genes. IFITM2, in contrast, promotes the upregulation of IL-6 by acting as a cell surface receptor for secreted BAG3. As BAG3 is also a well-characterized chaperone for selective autophagy, it will be of interest to determine if IFITM2 also participates with BAG3 in autophagy-related processes.

PIP3 subsequently serves as a second messenger allowing the binding of pleckstrin homology domain-containing proteins like Akt. Thereby the latter undergoes conformational changes leading to its phosphorylation and activation by PDK1 and mTORC2. Akt finally participates in the regulation of cellular processes like translation, cell growth and apoptosis by phosphorylating further proteins.

The duck RLR family consists of three cytoplasmic receptors: RIG-I, MDA5, and LGP2. RIG-I and MDA5 detect viral RNA species and initiate interferon signaling. LGP2 does not possess a signaling domain and may act as a positive or negative regulator of the other two. RIG-I recognizes 5\u201a\u00c4\u2264-triphosphorylated RNA \u201a\u00c4\u00fapanhandle\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 structures formed by the complementary ends of each influenza genome segment. MDA5 recognizes long double-stranded RNA. Ligand recognition leads to oligomerization of the receptors and releases the N-terminal caspase activation and recruitment domains (CARD) domains (shown as yellow rectangles) from repression by the C-terminal regulatory domain. Cytoplasmic zinc-finger antiviral protein (ZAP) protein may interact directly with RIG-I to stabilize RNA-bound tetramers. Short K-63-linked polyubiquitin chains synthesized by tripartite motif-containing protein 25 (TRIM25) stabilize the RIG-I CARD domain oligomers, which interact with similar CARD domains on mitochondrial MAVS. Duck Riplet appears to be missing its catalytic domain and likely cannot synthesize polyubiquitin chains. 2\u201a\u00c4\u2264-5\u201a\u00c4\u2264-oligoadenylate synthase-like protein (OASL) may stabilize RIG-I CARD domain oligomers with its own C-terminal ubiquitin-like domains in the absence of TRIM25-mediated ubiquitination. Activation of MAVS proteins leads them to multimerize in turn, and to serve as an assembly platform for a kinase cascade, which terminates in the phosphorylation of the transcription factor IRF7. A unique duck TRIM gene, TRIM27-L, promotes RIG-I signaling through an undefined interaction downstream of MAVS. Phosphorylated IRF7 dimerizes and is translocated to the nucleus where it initiates transcription of type I and type III interferon and interferon-stimulated genes. The expressed interferon is secreted to induce an antiviral state in the neighbouring cells and can also amplify RLR signaling in a positive feedback loop, since the pathway components are themselves interferon-inducible. RIG-I signaling activates stimulator of interferon gene (STING), an adaptor protein involved in sensing DNA viruses, which cross-talks with the RIG-I pathway. STING activation, in turn, prolongs the type I IFN response.","ocr":"LGP2\nor\nRIG-I (missing in chickens)\nMDA5\nLong dsRNA\n5'ppp-dsRNA\n\"panhandle\"\nTRIM27-L\nZAP\n(missing in chickens)\nUb Ub\nUb ub\nUb Ub\nTRIM25\nRiplet\nPositive\nParacrine signal to\nadjacent cells\n(inactive in Pekin ducks)\n(missing in chickens)\nfeedback\nOASL\nMAVS\nIRF7\nMitochondrion\nType I IFN and ISGS\nSTING\nNucleus\n","pmcid":"PMC6466002","papertitle":"Innate Immune Responses to Avian Influenza Viruses in Ducks and Chickens."}

For a schematic depiction of the strategy, the Notch-1 receptor signaling pathway is used as an example. After processing by the Furin protease and when activated by binding to its ligands Notch-1 is cleaved at the S2 position by the TACE protease, generating a substrate for \u0152\u2265-secretase (1, 7). Under enhanced (left panel) or inhibited (right panel) \u0152\u2265-secretase activity, the cleavage of the substrate controls the release of the Notch intracellular domain (NICD) (2, 8). With enhanced \u0152\u2265-secretase, increased numbers of NICDs enter the nucleus and interact with CSL (3), leading to the transcription of target genes like Hes1 and Hey (4). The Hes1 transcription repressor inhibits transcription of target genes like NC3C1 (5), with the final consequence being reduced production of NC3C1 mRNA (6). Thus, enhancing \u0152\u2265-secretase leads simultaneously to gene-dependent increase (in the case of Hes\/Hey) or decrease (in the case of NC3C1) of mRNA copy numbers.

ARTD15 is localized to either the nuclear envelope where it influences nuclear-cytoplasmic shuttling or to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) where it controls the unfolded protein response by modification of IRE1\u0152\u00b1 (inositol requiring enzyme 1) and PERK (protein kinase RNA-like ER kinase). ARTD7, ARTD8 and ARTD12 are associated with stress granule formation. In addition, ARTD12 localizes to the autophagy receptor p62 and might be a player in the regulation of the NF-\u0152\u222bB signaling pathway. Similarly, ARTD10 co-localizes with p62 in an ubiquitin-dependent manner and represses NF-\u0152\u222bB signaling. ARTD10, ARTD12 and ARTD14 have been suggested to inhibit translation as well as viral replication. SIRT4 is localized to mitochondria and regulates glutamate dehydrogenase (GDH) activity and glutamine metabolism.

Following release of viral nucleocapsid into the cytosol (5), transcription of the viral genome takes place (6). mRNA is subsequently translated by the host cell machinery (7). Synthesis of GP takes place at the ER and undergoes multiple posttranslational modifications on its way through the classical secretory pathway (8). Positive sense antigenomes are synthesized from the incoming viral genomes (9). These intermediate products then serve as templates to replicate new negative sense genomes (10). After cleavage in the Golgi, GP is transported to multivesicular bodies (MVB) and to the cell membrane where budding takes place (11).

RIG-I CTD is responsible for recognizing a plethora of RNA viruses with short 5\u201a\u00c4\u2264 triphosphate (5\u201a\u00c4\u2264ppp) RNA and 5\u201a\u00c4\u2264-diphosphate-bearing RNA structures.

(1) MERS-CoV infects macrophages through DPP4 binding, and then macrophages present MERS-CoV antigens to Th0 cells. This process leads to T cell activation and differentiation, including the production of cytokines associated with the different T cell subsets (i.e., Th1, Th2, and Th17), followed by a massive release of cytokines for immune response amplification. The continued production of these mediators due to viral persistence has a negative effect on Th0, NK, and CD8 T cell activation by inhibiting IL12 and IFN-\u0152\u2265 production. However, CD8 T cells produce very effective mediators, such as IFN-\u0152\u2265 and granzyme, to clear MERS-CoV. It is still unclear whether long-term or short-term protective antibodies are produced during neutralizing antibody production against MERS-CoV. (2) Attachment of MERS-CoV to DPP4 on the host cell through S protein leads to the appearance of genomic RNA in the cytoplasm. An immune response to dsRNA can be partially generated during MERS-CoV replication. TLR-3 sensitized by dsRNA and cascades of signaling pathways (IRFs and NF-\u0152\u222bB activation via TRAF3 and TRAF6, respectively) are activated to produce type I IFNs and proinflammatory cytokines. The production of type I IFNs is important to enhance the release of antiviral proteins for the protection of uninfected cells. Sometimes, accessory proteins of MERS-CoV can interfere with TLR-3 signaling and bind the dsRNA of MERS-CoV during replication to prevent TLR-3 activation and evade the immune response. TLR-4 might recognize S protein and lead to the activation of proinflammatory cytokines through the MyD88-dependent signaling pathway. Virus-cell interactions lead to strong production of immune mediators. The secretion of large quantities of chemokines and cytokines (MCP-1, IL10, and CXCL10) is promoted in infected cells in response to MERS-CoV infection. These chemokines and cytokines in turn recruit lymphocytes and leukocytes to the site of infection. Red arrows refer to inhibitory effects.

Anti-HSV-1 effects of TCM are mainly concentrated on the following three aspects: (i) TCM counteracts HSV-1 by regulating autophagy. mTOR (mammalian target of rapamycin) functions as a negative autophagy regulator. LFE can induce autophagy via decreasing the phosphorylation of mTOR and p70S6K (ribosomal p70S6 kinase). Consequently, Beclin-1 and LC3 (microtubule-associated protein 1 light chain 3)-II are activated, leading to autophagy-mediated clearance of HSV-1 []; (ii) TCM exerts anti-viral effects by enhancing immunity. For instance, as ingredients in the HCWEs, quercetin (1) and isoquercitrin (2) inhibit NF-\u0152\u222bB (nuclear factor-kappa B) activation []. Dpo (32) also improves the organism\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s immunity against HSV-1 in a STING-dependent manner, hence contributing to a sustained and significant increase in IRF7 (interferon regulatory factor 7) []. Similarly, APS (33) (astragalus polysaccharide) promots immunological function by markedly increasing the expression of TNF-\u0152\u00b1 (tumor necrosis factor-\u0152\u00b1), IL-6 (interleukin-6), TLR3 (toll-like receptor 3), and NF-\u0152\u222bB provoked by HSV-1 []. From another perspective, IRF3 (interferon regulatory factor 3) can also be phosphorylated, and phosphorylated IRF3 activated type I interferon expression by binding to ISRE (interferon-stimulated response element) []. However, after autophagy-dependent STING delivery of TBK1 (TANK-binding kinase 1) to endosomal\/lysosomal compartments, provoked ULK1 (unc-51 like autophagy activating kinase 1) can subsequently inhibit STING (Stimulator of Interferon Genes) function by phosphorylation S366, and IRF3 function is suppressed, thus preventing the persistent transcription of innate immune genes []. Mitochondria, the main organelles in eukaryotic cells, play an important role in antiviral process partially due to the mitochondrial localiazation of MAVS (Mitochondrial antiviral-signaling protein). Interestingly, the NEMO (the regulatory subunit of the IKK complex) dependent cGAS-MAVS-TBK1 signaling pathway is essential for IRF3 and NF-\u0152\u222bB activation []; and (iii) TCM exerts antiviral effects by inhibiting HSV-1 replication or inactivation of HSV-1 in the process of viral attachment\/absorption\/penetration. HCWEs and quercetin (1) inhibit the infection of HSV-1 via blocking of viral binding and penetration. Additionally, HCWEs, Norcepharadione B (3), and curcumin (35) can inhibit viral replication [,,]. Notoginsenoside ST-4 (21) prevents HSV-1 from penetrating into cells and effectively blocks the synthesis of vp5 []. NN-B-5 interrupts the formation of \u0152\u00b1TIF\/C1\/Oct-1\/GARAT multiprotein\/DNA complexes, resulting in reduced expression of ICP0 (infected cell polypeptide 0) and ICP4 []. HSV-1, which can escape from various antiviral pathways, can cascade linearly and express immediate early (IE), early (E), and late (L) genes. After expression of the L gene, the cells produce a large number of mature viral particles, causing the cells to rupture and die.

Virus entry into cell proceeds through receptor-mediated endocytosis at the cell surface. Subsequent to internalization, the viral envelope fuses with the endosomal membrane under acidic pH, and the viral genome is uncoated and released into the cytoplasm. To dissect these two events, internalization and fusion are conventionally depicted as two seemingly separate steps in the cytoplasm. Viral RNA is translated at the ER to produce the polyprotein, which is subsequently processed into mature structural and non-structural proteins. Viral non-structural proteins, in conjunction with host factors, form a membranous web where viral RNA replication occurs. HCV particle assembly most likely initiates near the ER and LD where core protein and viral RNA accumulate. Finally, HCV particles are secreted into the extracellular milieu via the secretory pathway.

(2.) Phosphorylated CEACAM1 can bind to SHP-2 to sequester the phosphatase and subsequently, mediate more sustained phosphorylation of the IRS-1\/PI3K\/AKT pathway that transduces the metabolic effects of insulin, such as inhibiting gluconeogenesis (via phosphorylating and nuclear exclusion of forkhead box protein O1 (Foxo1), among others [,,]).

The UPR may be induced by pharmacological chemicals, such as tunicamycin, thapsigargin, homocysteine, reductive\/oxidative agents as well as non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agents, which impose stress on the ER by causing the vigorous protein synthesis, the imbalance of ER Ca2+ and redox, and the inhibition of protein modification or transfer to the Golgi body. In mammalian cells, ER stress also occurs under many circumstances, such as nutrient deprivation, developmental processes, genetic mutation, as well as pathogenic insult. The best-known example of ER stress arising from genetic mutation is the protein-misfolding diseases in human. Recent reports in plants have indicated a close connection between the UPR and environmental stimuli such as heat, salt, and drought stress as well as viral attack, although the underlying mechanisms are largely unknown. The purpose of the induced UPR is to restore the ER function and relive the stress exerted on the ER. In addition, the UPR also eliminates the cytotoxic malformed proteins, which are dislocated across the ER membrane for ubiquitination (Ub) and proteasome-mediated degradation through a pathway known as ERAD. However, if ER homeostasis or function cannot be re-established, programmed cell death will be activated by the UPR, presumably to protect the organism from the rogue cells that display misfolded proteins, which has not yet been confirmed in plants and is not shown in the diagram.","ocr":"Abiotic stresses\nGenetic mutations\nNutrient deprivation Stimuli\nPharmacological agents\nDevelopmental processes\nViral and bacterial pathogens\nATP depletion\nVigorous protein synthesis\nAberration of Ca\u00b2+ or redox homeostasis\nInhibition of protein modification\nInhibition of protein transfer to Golgi\nRelieve\nUnfolded proteins\nRestore\nUb\n26 S\nERAD\nPrevent\nUPR genes\n","pmcid":"PMC3531707","papertitle":"Virus-induced ER stress and the unfolded protein response."}

Interaction between CD81 and claudin 1 facilitates viral uptake by clathrin-mediated endocytosis. Endosomal low pH triggers membrane fusion and release of genome into the cytoplasm. The positive-sense (+), single-stranded RNA is translated by an internal ribosome entry site (IRES) element at its 5' untranslated region (UTR) into a single polypeptide, which is then cleaved into the core, E1, E2, p7, NS2, NS3, NS4A, NS4B, NS5A, and NS5B by host signal peptidase (purple scissor) and signal peptide peptidase (pink scissor) and viral autoprotease (NS2-3) (fluorescent green scissor) and serine protease (NS3-NS4A) (dark green scissor). Replication is catalyzed by the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase NS5B, assisted by the helicase activity of NS3, via a negative-sense (\u201a\u00e0\u00ed) intermediate RNA (red arrows). Replication takes place in the membranous web, which consists of single, double and multiple membrane vesicles. Formation of the membranous web is induced by NS4B and NS5A. Assembly of virion is initiated on core-coated lipid droplets (LD) followed by budding into the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), where it is coated by the ER-resident envelope proteins E1 and E2. Egress follows the secretory pathway to release the virion to extracellular space. The viroporin, p7, forms ion channels to equilibrate pH gradients during trafficking through the secretory pathway to protect the virion.","ocr":"entry\negress\nIRES\n3' UTR\n+ RNA\nC E1 E2 p7 NS2\nNS3\nNS4A NS4B\nNSSA\nNS5B\n3'\nRNA\n5'\nendocytosis\nfusion\nER\nmembranous web\nnucleus\n2.\nCD81 SRB1 GAG\nclaudin 1 occludin\ntight\njunction\n","pmcid":"PMC4033015","papertitle":"Unfolded protein response in hepatitis C virus infection."}

(A) Tetherin resides in the plasma membrane and is constitutively recycled from the plasma membrane via endosomes and the trans-Golgi network (TGN). The antiviral activity of tetherin is counteracted by the Vpu and Nef proteins. During HIV-1 infection, Vpu binds to the transmembrane domain of tetherin in the endoplasmic reticulum and Golgi network and sequesters it in endosomal regions in a clathrin-dependent manner. This rerouting of tetherin from the plasma membrane leads to its degradation in lysosomes via the ESCRT pathway. SIV Nef, too, is able to antagonise tetherin activity by sequestering tetherin from the sites of virus assembly, leading to lysosomal degradation of the entrapped molecules. (B) In the absence of Vpu and Nef activity, tetherin accumulates at virus assembly sites and blocks virus release from the plasma membrane. This clustering of retained virions triggers a signalling cascade mediated by tetherin\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s cytoplasmic tail that leads to NF-\u0152\u222bB activation and release of proinflammatory cytokines. This sensing of retention is reliant on tetherin association with the actin cytoskeleton via the adaptor protein RICH2. (C) Signalling that ultimately leads to NF-\u0152\u222bB activation triggered by the phosphorylation of tetherin monomers and recruitment of the Syk kinase. This in turn leads to recruitment of the E3 ligases TRAF2 and TRAF6, that with the E2 enzyme UBC13, and K63-ubiquitin-mediated activation of the kinase TAK1 to activate NF-\u0152\u222bB (D) Virions tethered at the cell surface are also exposed to anti-Env antibodies that thereby sensitise the infected cell to anti-HIV antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC) responses from Fc-receptor expressing myeloid and NK cells. (E) Tetherin is able to further modulate the cell\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s innate immunity through activation of the plasmacytoid dendritic cell specific leukocyte inhibitory receptor ILT7.

During entry into the ER, the oligosaccharyltransferase complex (OST) transfers a preformed Glc3Man9 NAc2 glycan precursor to the Asn of the Asn\u201a\u00c4\u00eaX\u201a\u00c4\u00eaSer\/Thr motif in the polypeptide chain.

MyD88-deficient DCs exhibit a strongly delayed Egr-1 response and MEK1\/2 inhibition abolishes Egr-1 activation, with a minor contribution of the p38 MAPK pathway. Rapid high Egr-1 expression is consistent with cell activation and migration. The migratory responses of T. gondii-challenged DCs are abolished by inhibition of ERK1\/2 signaling. (B) Extended phase. In actively invaded DCs, intracellular T. gondii tachyzoites replicate in a parasitophorous vacuole (PV) and secrete in the host DC cytosol the p38-interacting protein GRA24, leading to p38 phosphorylation. Pharmacological inhibition of p38 phosphorylation or challenge with GRA24-deficient T. gondii abolish a sustained Egr-1 response. Sustained Egr-1 expression leads to a down-modulation of DC maturation. In Egr-1-silenced DCs maturation is elevated upon LPS or T. gondii challenge.

Following the cellular receptor-mediated entry into the target cells, the genomic RNAs of both PEDV and PDCoV are released into the cytosol by viral-host membrane fusion. During the cytokine induction phase, the presence of the virus-derived RNA genome as well as other replicative RNA intermediates are sensed by both the endosomal TLRs (TLR3, 7\/8) and cytosolic RLRs (RIG-I and MDA5). The recognition of the virus-derived RNAs by these receptors triggers a cascade of signaling molecule activation leading to a nuclear translocation of the key transcription factors including NF-\u0152\u222bB, IRF1, IRF3, and IRF7. Inside the nucleus, the binding of these transcription factors to their respective PRD regions drives the production of type I and type III IFNs, and pro-inflammatory cytokines which are then secreted into the extracellular space. Subsequently, in the signaling phase, the engagement of both type I and III IFNs to their cognate receptors in both autocrine and paracrine manner induces the activation of JAK\/STAT pathway leading to nuclear translocation of the ISGF3 complex as well as the subsequent production of the interferon stimulating genes (ISGs) (A). These ISGs confer the cells with an anti-viral state. In order to ensure the establishment of a successful infection, both PEDV and PDCoV either produce viral proteins (shown in red for those of PEDV and in yellow of PDCoV) to directly antagonize various critical steps of both IFN induction and signaling or affect indirectly the host cell anti-viral signaling cascades (B).","ocr":"TyePH\nPRDV\nTrpe N\nExtracellular space\nEstca pe\nIFNARIU\nAPM\nReceptan\nEGR\nFALRV\nkytapla\nCytoplasm\nBrudesore\nEndngne\n\u09e7\nSGFS\ngRAFE\nMA\nNacles\nPre-\n\u0b9a\ncytakines\nORL\nCREE\nCPERAMngpotn\nInduction Phase\nSignaling Phase\nInduction Phase\nSignaling Phane\n","pmcid":"PMC6395401","papertitle":"PEDV and PDCoV Pathogenesis: The Interplay Between Host Innate Immune Responses and Porcine Enteric Coronaviruses."}

(A) Current model of the cellular events involved in autophagic pathway, include membrane nucleation, elongation and completion of autophagosome, and maturation of autolysosome. In response to nutrient starvation, the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) complex dissociates from the unc-51 like-kinase 1 or 2 (ULK1 or ULK2) complex, leading to dephosphorylation, activation, and translocation of ULK1\/2 complex to ER. Then the ER-localized ULK1\/2 complex activates the class III phosphatidylinositol-3-OH kinase (class III-PI3K) complex, leading to generation of PtdIn(3)P which recruits double-FYVE-containing protein 1 (DFCP1) and WD-repeat domain PtdIns(3)P-interacting (WIPI) proteins onto the isolation membrane of ER, also called omegasome. Two ubiquitin-like conjugation systems including ATG12-ATG5-ATG16L and ATG4-ATG3-LC3II pathways are coordinated with the elongation and enclosure of autophagosome. Finally, the autophagosome fuses with lysosome, and the sequestrated materials are degraded in the autolysosome. (B) Ubiquitin-like conjugation cascades of ATG12-ATG5-ATG16L and ATG4-ATG3-LC3II. Upper panel: ATG12 is first activated by ATG7 (E1-like enzyme) through the formation of thioester bonding between the C-terminal glycine of ATG12 and the active site cysteine residue of ATG7 in an ATP hydrolysis-dependent manner. Then the activated ATG12 is transferred to ATG10 (E2-like enzyme) via a thioesterification reaction, and finally forms a conjugate with ATG5. The ATG5-ATG12 conjugate interacts with ATG16 to form an ATG5-ATG12-ATG16 complex. Bottom panel: LC3 is processed by the cysteine protease ATG4, resulting in exposure of the C-terminal glycine of LC3. The exposed glycine of LC3 is activated by ATG7 (E1-like enzyme), transferred to ATG3 (E2-like enzyme), and then covalently linked to phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) to form the lipidated form of LC3, i.e., LC3-II.

(B) Schematic description of N-glycosylation, endoplasmic reticulum-associated protein degradation (ERAD), and endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress pathways. Nascent polypeptides are translocated through Sec61 into the rough ER, where the core oligosaccharide is transferred from a dolichol phosphate onto asparagine residues in asparagine-X-serine\/threonine (NXS\/T) motifs (I). The two terminal glucose residues on the core oligosaccharide are trimmed by glucosidase I, (GI) (II), and GII (III), respectively, allowing for the association with the chaperones, membrane-bound calnexin (CNX) and and\/or soluble calreticulin (CRT), which promote folding to a native conformation. Eventually, the last terminal glucose residue will be trimmed by GII, and the glycoprotein will attain a native conformation (IV), or misfold (VII). Glycoproteins that reach a native conformation will have the terminal \u0152\u00b11,2-Man residue on the b branch removed by ER class I \u0152\u00b1-mannosidase (ERManI) (V), as a signal to allow it to traverse the canonical secretory pathway for surface presentation or secretion (VI).

Cargo binds to the plasma membrane, is endocytosed by a plethora of processes and, independently of the entry route, is transported to early endosomes (EE). From this sub-compartment, cargo is sorted to one of three destinations: recycling, degradation, or secretion. These routes require maturation of the EE into recycling endosomes or multivesicular bodies (MVBs), which can either fuse with lysosomes (L) to generate endolysosomes (EL) or with the plasma membrane to release intraluminal vesicles to the milieu as exosomes. The membranes of the sub-compartments of the endocytic pathway have different compositions. Specific members of the Rab GTPase family, for example, are differentially enriched in each sub-compartment: Rab5 is enriched in EE; Rab7 in MVBs; Rab11, Rab25, Rab4, and Rab35 in the slow and rapid recycling routes; and Rab27a\/b in MVBs. Rab9 is present in vesicles destined for retrograde transport to the trans-Golgi network (TGN). In uninfected cells, interfering with these Rabs affects exosome release. Many viruses use these Rabs in diverse steps of the viral life cycle, although whether this usage impacts in exosomal release has not been investigated. For example, at late stages of infection, viruses such as IAV, RSV, Sendai virus (SeV), and Andes virus (ANDV) were shown to hijack Rab11 vesicles to transport their progeny RNA to the cell surface. HIV, HSV1, and human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) were shown to require Rab27a\/b vesicles for assembly. Human herpes 6 (HHV-6) virions were shown to be secreted upon fusion of MVB with the plasma membrane, together with exosomes.","ocr":"MICROVESICLES\n(50-1000 nm)\nEXOSOMES\nExtracellular milieu\n(30-100 nm)\nCytoplasm\nRECYCLING\nRab 11\n(fast)\nRab 25\nRSV\nRab 4\nIAV\nRab 35\nHIV\nSev\nANDV\nRab 11\nRab 5\nEE\nRECYCLING\nRab 27\n(slow)\nRab 7\nSECRETION\nHSV1\nMVB\n\u041d\u0421MV\n\u041dHY-6\nMVB\nRab 7\nRECYCLING\n& SECRETION\nRab 9\nMVB\nRab 7\nTGN\/GOLGI\nRab 7\nDEGRADATION\nRab 7\nEL\nRab 9\n","pmcid":"PMC4584306","papertitle":"Exosome Biogenesis, Regulation, and Function in Viral Infection."}

Thereafter, the ULK1 complex regulates the class III PI3K complex. Atg9L, a multimembrane spanning protein, is also involved in an early stage of autophagosome formation by probably supplying part of the membranes necessary for the formation and\/or expansion. Local formation of PI3P at sites called omegasomes promotes the formation of the phagophore, from which autophagosomes appear to be generated. The PI3P-binding WIPI proteins (yeast Atg18 homolog), as well as the Atg12-Atg5-Atg16L1 complex and the LC3-phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) conjugate play important roles in the elongation and closure of the isolation membrane. Finally, the complete autophagosome fuses with endosomes or endosome-derived vesicles forming the amphisome, which subsequently fuses with lysosomes to form autolysosomes. In the lysosomes, the cytoplasmic materials engulfed by the autophagosomes are degraded by resident hydrolases. The resulting amino acids and other basic cellular constituents are reused by the cell; when in high levels they also reactivate mTORC1 and then suppress autophagy.","ocr":"ER\nAutophagosome\nEndosome\/endosome-\nderived vesicles\nAmphisome\nAtg12-Atg5\nAtg16L\nPhagophore\nWIPIS\nLysosomes\nPI3P\nOmegasome\n\u0420\u0406\u0417\u041a\ncomplex\nInsulin\ngrowth factors\nULKI\ncomplex\nmTORCI\nAutolysosome\nAmino acids\nAtg9L.\nvesicle\n","pmcid":"PMC3362037","papertitle":"Autophagy: More Than a Nonselective Pathway."}

Replication is catalysed by the polymerase and viral cofactors NP, VP30 and VP35 (4).

The mTOR complex mTORC1 acts upstream of the autophagic pathway to suppress autophagic membrane formation, and mTOR activity can be monitored by detecting the activation of its downstream target S6 kinase. mTORC1 is inhibited when autophagy is induced via a cellular stress such as starvation or a drug treatment like rapamycin. 2. After initiation of autophagy, a complex containing the Atg protein Beclin-1 is necessary for autophagosome formation. Tamoxifen induces autophagy by indirectly acting upon Beclin-1, while 3-MA suppresses autophagy due to its inhibition of PI3 kinases that interact with Beclin-1. The picornaviruses PV, CVB3, HRV-2, HRV-14, EV71, FMDV and EMCV have been shown to induce autophagic membrane formation. 3. During autophagic membrane formation, the cytosolic Atg protein LC3-I becomes conjugated to PE, mediated in part by the ubiquitin E1-like enzyme Atg7, to form LC3-II. LC3-II proteins then specifically associate with a newly-formed crescent-shaped membrane termed a phagophore. The conversion of LC3-I to LC3-II has been observed with all of the picornaviruses discussed at length in this review. 4. The phagophore elongates around cytosolic contents until the contents are completely sequestered within a fully formed double-membraned autophagosome. The formation of the autophagosome requires the ubiquitin-like protein Atg12. 5. The autophagosome matures, becoming acidic, and fuses with lysosomes to form the degradative autolysosome. The cytosolic contents are degraded, and LC3-II is also degraded or recycled back to LC3-I. CVB3 appears to block this degradative step, while EMCV does not.","ocr":"\u0160tarvation\nS6K\nRapamycin\nPV\nCVB3\n3-Methyladenine\nTamoxifen\nHRV-2\n3\n(2\nHRV-14\nEV71\nFMDV\nMTOR\nPI3K\nLC3-1\ncomplex\nBeclin-1\nEMCV\ncomplex\nAcidification of\nAtg7\nautophagosome\nPE\nAutophagic\nLysosomes\nmembrane formation\nLC3-1I\nAtg12\n5\nUptake of\ncytosolic\n.contents\nCVB3\nPhagophore\nAutophagosome\nAutolysosome\n","pmcid":"PMC3187694","papertitle":"Picornavirus Subversion of the Autophagy Pathway."}

Furthermore, NS3 interacts with E, NS2A, and NS2B and these proteins are degraded by viperin in a NS3-dependent manner.

Transport steps are indicated by arrows. Secretory cargos are synthesized in the ribosome-studded ER, exit the ER at ERES in COPII-coated (brown) vesicles and are transported to the ER-Golgi compartment (ERGIC) and then to the Golgi. After passage through the Golgi complex in the cis-to-trans direction, cargos are packaged at the TGN for delivery to the PM, early and late endosomes and in some cells to secretory granules. Sorting into endosomal compartments and secretory granules is mediated by clathrin-coated (red) vesicles. Transport to the PM is mediated by transport tubules. A COPI-mediated (green) recycling pathway retrieves escaped proteins from the ERGIC and the Golgi and returns them to the ER. Multivesicular bodies form by invaginations of endosomal membrane into its lumen and can fuse with the PM to release their content of exosomal vesicles.","ocr":"lysosome\nlate\nGOLGI\nendosome\nPM\nCOMPLEX\nmedial\ncis\nER\nCOPI\n|trans\nTGN\nvesicle\nclathrin\nendosome\nmultivesicular\nbody\nERES\nCOPI\nvesicle ERGIC\ntransport tubule\nclathrin\nsecretory\ngranules\n","pmcid":"PMC6213159","papertitle":"Role of Host Cell Secretory Machinery in Zika Virus Life Cycle."}

The roles contributing to viral pathogenesis and host-cell strategies used to respond to viral infection are coloured blue and red, respectively. Green and pink indicate oligomannose and complex-type N-linked glycan processing states, respectively. (A) Glycoprotein Folding and Trafficking. As with all glycoproteins, glycans on viral glycoproteins aid in folding and trafficking through the host secretory pathway. (B) Glycosylation in Viral Release. Glycosylation of infected host cell proteins can influence viral spread. (C) Immune Evasion Using Secreted\/Shed Glycoproteins. Viruses can shed or secrete glycoproteins to act as immune decoys. (D) Immune Evasion by Molecular Mimicry and Glycan Shielding. Extensively glycosylated viral proteins shield themselves from the host immune response by occluding the immunogenic proteinous surface with a dense coat of host-derived glycans. (E) Glycans as Attachment Factors and Enhanced Uptake by Immune Cells. Some virus envelope-displayed glycoproteins contain under-processed oligomannose-type glycans that function as host-cell attachment factors to augment or facilitate infection of immune cells. (F) Host Glycans as Attachment Factors. Viruses can recognise glycans presented on host cell-surface proteins to facilitate host cell attachment. (G) Soluble Lectins of the Innate Immune System and Complement Activation. As under-processed glycans are rarely presented on mature host cell glycoproteins [,], the innate immune system is able to recognise these glycans as pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) using soluble lectins.

Phagophores are the initial precursor structure of this transport pathway. These membrane cisterns are formed at the PAS by the Atg machinery, which also catalyzes their expansion into autophagosomes through the acquisition of extra lipid bilayers. During this latter event, the growing phagophore sequesters cytoplasmic components or specific structures depending on the autophagy-inducing conditions. The closure of the expanding phagophore leads to the formation of a double-membrane vesicle called an autophagosome, which contains the cargo targeted for degradation. The Atg machinery is then released from the surface and the complete autophagosomes, which initially fuse with endosomal compartments generating amphisomes. While the cargo material starts to be already turned over in the amphisomes, the exposure to hydrolases by fusion with lysosomes to form autolysosomes allows its complete degradation into basic metabolites such as amino acids and sugars, which are transported in the cytoplasm and used as an energy source or building blocks for the synthesis of new macromolecules.
